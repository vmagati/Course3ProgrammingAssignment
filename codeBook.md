## Variables
  - Subject: contains data of 30 volunteers within an age of 19-48 years, with each performing six activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist. These subjects were randomly partitioned into two sets, 70% of which generated training data, and 30% of which generated test data, as indicated in the text file
  - Activity: contains data of the activity performed by the subject, of which there are six: walking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, standing, and laying
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-X: contains data of the average triaxial acceleration in the X-axis recorded from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope for each activity for each subject
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-Y: contains data of the average triaxial acceleration in the Y-axis recorded from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope for each activity for each subject
  - tBodyAcc-mean()-Z: contains data of the average triaxial acceleration in the Z-axis recorded from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope for each activity for each subject
  - tBodyAcc-std()-X: contains data of the standard deviation in the triaxial acceleration in the X-axis recorded from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope for each activity for each subject
  - tBodyAcc-std()-Y: contains data of the standard deviation in the triaxial acceleration in the Y-axis recorded from the smartphone's embedded accelerometer and gyroscope for each activity for each subject
