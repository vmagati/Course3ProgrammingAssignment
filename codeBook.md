## Variables
  - Subject: contains data of 30 volunteers within an age of 19-48 years, with each performing six activities while wearing a smartphone on their waist. These subjects were randomly partitioned into two sets, 70% of which generated training data, and 30% of which generated test data, as indicated in the text file
